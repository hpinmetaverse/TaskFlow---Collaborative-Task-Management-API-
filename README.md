# TaskFlow---Collaborative-Task-Management-API-

This is the backend server for a team task management app, developed during my internship at **Brainworx Infovision**.

### Project Context

During my internship, I was given the opportunity to observe a professional SaaS development team. To apply the concepts I was seeing in their meetings, I was guided to build this foundational backend project.

*   **Team Workspaces:** Users can create project spaces to organize their work.
*   **Task Management:** Full ability to create, view, update, and delete tasks.
*   **Collaboration:** A system to invite team members to a workspace and assign tasks.
